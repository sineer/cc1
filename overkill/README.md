# Production Overkill Features

This folder contains enterprise-grade production features that were implemented but deemed overkill for the current UCI config tool needs.

## Contents

### `/lib/` - Production Libraries
- **production_error_handler.lua** - Robust error handling with automatic rollback and recovery mechanisms
- **production_logger.lua** - Structured logging system with audit trails and performance metrics
- **network_monitor.lua** - Real-time network connectivity monitoring during operations
- **config_version_manager.lua** - Configuration versioning and drift detection capabilities
- **fleet_manager.lua** - Fleet management for batch operations across multiple devices

### `/lib/commands/` - Production Commands
- **production_command.lua** - Enterprise production deployment and fleet management command

### Root Files
- **production-demo.sh** - Demo script showcasing all production capabilities

## Features Implemented

These production features provide:
- Multi-level error classification and automatic recovery
- Compliance-ready audit trails (SOX, PCI-DSS)
- Real-time network monitoring with auto-recovery
- Git-based configuration versioning
- Fleet-wide orchestrated deployments
- Canary and blue-green deployment strategies

## Usage

If you ever need these enterprise features, you can integrate them back by:
1. Copying the files from overkill/ to their original locations
2. Adding the production command to bin/uci-config
3. Installing any missing dependencies (like luafilesystem)

These features transform the UCI config tool into an enterprise-grade network infrastructure management platform suitable for managing critical production systems at scale.
